# Modelling and Optimization of the Unit Dispatch System of an Emergency Service

The optimal engagement of a rescue team following an emergency call does not necessarily result in the assignment of the one offering the shortest transit delay. It should be used in cases where the urgency is known. However, this selection should be put into perspective for situations that are less critical. For these less critical cases, the service coverage preservation should be taken into account in order to ensure a good quality of service for emergency assistance requests with proven severity. Today, information systems for the allocation of rescue services seem to be dissociated from their geographic information systems. In order to reach an optimal allocation, these two systems must communicate so that the allocation phase takes into account transit delays and coverage factors. Bearing this in mind, the present work defines a logic, identifies challenges, and proposes technologies and architecture for the Paris Fire Brigade. The realization of this information technology project should provide the emergency service with real-time quality of service information and result in an improvement of its allocation system.
